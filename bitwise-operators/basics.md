Data in the RAM is always organised as a sequence of bits and eight bits come together to make one byte. C can be used to perform actions on these bits of data- and when we will to do so, we take the help of bitwise-operators. Six bitwise-operators are supported in C- the AND, OR, XOR, complement, left-shit and right-shift operators- the symbols for which are &, |, ^, -, <<, >> respectively.
